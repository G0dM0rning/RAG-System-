# A RAG system that takes the document at runtime.


**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System Overview**

This project features a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for highly accurate document-based question answering. Users can upload any document at runtime and immediately benefit from advanced retrieval capabilities.

**Key Features**

Dynamic Document Handling
Upload documents on the flyâ€”no need to pre-process or configure data ahead of time.

  **Smart Document Chunking**
  
    Upon upload, documents are automatically split into smaller, manageable chunks, optimizing both search efficiency and retrieval accuracy.

  **Embedding Creation**
  
    Each chunk is transformed into a dense vector representation (embedding) using state-of-the-art embedding models. This allows the system to capture the true semantic meaning of the text beyond mere keywords.

  **Vector Database Storage**
  
    All embeddings are stored in a high-performance vector database, enabling rapid semantic search across large collections of document chunks.

  **Semantic Search-Based QA**
  
    When a user asks a question, the system searches for semantically related chunks within the vector database. Relevant chunks are retrieved and used to generate highly precise, context-aware answers to the         user's query.

**Workflow**

  **Document Upload**
    Users upload a document through the application interface.

  **Preprocessing**
    The system breaks the document into smaller units (chunks).

  **Embedding Generation**
    Each chunk is embedded into a vector for semantic indexing.

**Storage**
Embeddings are saved in a vector database for efficient retrieval.

**Question Answering**
When a question is asked, the system finds and uses the most relevant document chunks based on their semantic similarity to the query.

**Benefits**
Answers are grounded in the latest uploaded documents, not limited by static model knowledge.

Semantic retrieval provides more relevant and reliable responses compared to classic keyword-based search.

System is scalable and suited for varied domains, supporting both individual use and team collaboration.

This solution delivers a highly flexible and accurate way to query your own documents using modern RAG technology, ensuring your answers are always based on the most relevant, up-to-date information.
